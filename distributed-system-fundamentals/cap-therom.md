Distributed computing systems cannot guarantee the following three characteristics at the same time: strong consistency, high availability, and partitioning. Therefore, in the design of distributed systems, it is often necessary to weaken the guarantee of one of the characteristics [\[1\]](cap-therom.md#reference).

* **Strong consistency:** all nodes in the distributed system can see the same data content at any time.
* **High availability:** Any node in the distributed system that is not non-faulty can respond to the request.
* **Partitioned tolerance:** The network may be partitioned, meaning that communication between partitioned nodes is not guaranteed.
